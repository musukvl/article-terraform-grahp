Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place
-/+ destroy and then create replacement
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # data.azurerm_resource_group.graph_example_rg will be read during apply
  # (depends on a resource or a module with changes pending)
